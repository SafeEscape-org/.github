## ‚ú® Project Overview

SafeEscape is a comprehensive disaster management and emergency response system designed to empower individuals and communities during critical times. Built with a focus on real-time information delivery, intelligent guidance, and maximum accessibility, SafeEscape serves as the ultimate safety platform during crises.

> Developed as part of the **GDG SOLUTION CHALLENGE** hackathon, SafeEscape addresses UN Sustainable Development Goal #11: **Sustainable Cities and Communities** by providing robust emergency infrastructure.

## üí° The Problem SafeEscape Solves

As natural disasters increase in frequency and severity worldwide, the need for effective emergency response systems has never been more critical. Current solutions often suffer from:

- **Fragmentation** across multiple platforms and agencies
- **Delayed updates** during rapidly evolving situations
- **Poor accessibility** in areas with limited connectivity
- **Generic guidance** that fails to account for individual circumstances
- **Complex interfaces** that are difficult to navigate during high-stress situations

SafeEscape addresses these challenges by offering a unified, intelligent, and reliable platform that functions as a lifeline when every second counts.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Accessibility Features**: Voice commands, high-contrast modes, and screen reader compatibility.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Available in multiple languages to serve diverse communities.
- **Battery Optimization**: Minimal battery usage to extend device life during prolonged emergencies.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

SafeEscape follows a modular and scalable architecture that ensures reliability during critical situations:

![Architecture Diagram]()

### Frontend (Mobile Application)

- **Presentation Layer**: Flutter-based UI/UX components with responsive design and offline capability.
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and use cases independent of UI implementation.
- **Data Layer**: Repositories managing local storage and API interactions.
- **Core**: Shared utilities, constants, and configurations.

### Backend (Server Infrastructure)

- **API Services**: Node.js/Express handlers for data requests and user information.
- **Real-time Services**: Socket.IO and Google Cloud Pub/Sub for instant communication.
- **Vertex AI Layer**: AI-powered chatbot, evacuation optimizer, and prediction models.
- **External Services Integration**: Weather services, seismic data providers, and mapping APIs.

This architecture ensures maintainability, scalability, and clear separation between the mobile application and the powerful backend services.

## üîó Repositories

This project is split into two main repositories:

- **Frontend (Mobile App)**: [SafeEscape-org/SafeEscape](https://github.com/SafeEscape-org/SafeEscape)
- **Backend (API & Services)**: [SafeEscape-org/SafeEscape-backend](https://github.com/SafeEscape-org/SafeEscape-backend)

## üöÄ Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before setting up SafeEscape, ensure you have the following installed:

- Flutter SDK (2.10.0 or higher)
- Dart (2.16.0 or higher)
- Node.js (14.x or higher)
- npm (6.x or higher) or yarn (1.22.x or higher)
- Firebase account with a configured project
- Google Cloud Platform account with necessary APIs enabled
- Google Maps API key

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repositories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SafeEscape-org/SafeEscape.git
git clone https://github.com/SafeEscape-org/SafeEscape-backend.git
```

#### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd SafeEscape
flutter pub get
```

Then:
- Create a Firebase project and add applications (Android/iOS)
- Download and place your Firebase configuration files:
  - For Android: `android/app/google-services.json`
  - For iOS: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- Configure Google Maps API keys in:
  - Android: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
  - iOS: `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` or `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

#### 3. Backend Setup

```bash
cd ../SafeEscape-backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with your:
- Firebase service account key path
- Google Maps API key
- Google Cloud project configurations
- Other required API keys and configurations

#### 4. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd SafeEscape-backend
npm run dev
```

The backend server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

#### 5. Run the Frontend Application

```bash
cd ../SafeEscape
flutter run
```

The Flutter app should build and run on your connected device or emulator. Ensure it can connect to the running backend server.

### Common Issues & Troubleshooting

- **Firebase Connection Issues**: Verify your `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` files are correctly placed
- **Google Maps Not Loading**: Check your API key restrictions and enable the necessary APIs in Google Cloud Console
- **Backend Connection Errors**: Ensure the backend URL in the frontend configuration matches your running server

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

The SafeEscape backend utilizes GitHub Actions for a streamlined CI/CD workflow:
